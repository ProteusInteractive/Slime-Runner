To do next :
  1. If no raycast hit, stop player move
  2. Check raycast Y and return player message if hex is raised/neut/lowered
  3. Work out how to highlight raycast hit hex
  4. Bonus points - can we check if hex under player is the same one being raycasted, and look for next one in same direction?
